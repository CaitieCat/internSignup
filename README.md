## Internship Signup Page

!["Gif of page functionality"](https://github.com/CaitieCat/northernChallenge/blob/main/public/images/NorthernChallenge.gif?raw=true)

A small page built in React to act as a signup form for potential internship candidates. Candidates can submit their email address and area of interest by using the input fields available. Once submitted, the page console logs the information to the browser console, simulates an http request, and displays a thank you message. The form may only be submitted once, with an error message appearing to those who do not include a valid email address.
